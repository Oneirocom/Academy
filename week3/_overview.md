# Week 3

## Embeddings

# First, what is a word?
- We can think of a word as a vector of numbers
- word2vec is a way to turn a word into a vector of numbers

# We can do this with images too!
- img2vec does the same thing as word2vec, basically

# What is a vector?
[0, 1, 2]

- Visualization of vectors here: https://www.math3d.org/vectors
- Further help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml4NSzCQobk

Vectors are a way to describe data as a point in n-dimensional space (but 2D or 3D is nce for visualization)

- Words can each have a vector
- Sentences can be represented as a vector, too!
- Google image search converts images into vectors!

# So how does that relate to embeddings?
- A vector is an array of numbers, i.e. [0, 4, 2]
- embeddings are a type of vector, i.e. [0, 4, 2]
- the vector is n-dimensional (many more than 3D) and doesn't represent anything obvious, generateed from a language model

vector = embedding -- vector search = similarity search = embedding comparison

# How do we get from a word or sentence to a bunch of vectors?
- We use a language model to generate embeddings
- Specifically we use the "ada-embeddings-002" model from OpenAI
- Google PaLM support for embeddings soon too!

# Embedding concepts

We can embed entire concepts or ideas into a vector

- WTF? For 5 words?
- Yeah. The ada model has a fixed dimension of 1536 numbers. Different models have different numbers
- NOTE: a paragraph and a single word have the same dimensions, so in the future we will break up documents into paragraphs and then into sentences to capture the concept details in high resolution

# Vector Search
- We can use a vector database to store memories and recall them based on similarity
- Similarity is computed by comparing the distance of the vectors from each other

## knn vs ann
- knn is the most popular, but it's slow, however it works with postgres (standard database)
- ann is faster, but it's more complicated to integrate, requires a specialized database

- the most popular and best implementation of ANN is HNSW
"Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs" - https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320
- HNSW is used by Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone, Haystack, Milvus, and FAISS

- In Magick we currently use a knn with pgvector, but we're integrating many vector stores through langchain.js

- Also support Pinecone, but only reading for now

## What can we use this for?
- Classification -- does this idea fit within one of our categories?
- Retrieval -- what is the most similar idea to this one?
- Moderation -- is this idea similar to any of our banned ideas?

and of course...
### Long term memory
- We can store memories in a vector database and recall them based on conceptual similarity

## To Magick!

- Review events and short term memory
- Introduce create embedding node and demonstrate output
- Implement embeddings in graph
- Introduce exlusive gate node
- Find Cached Embedding node, save cost and money!
