### String = Text
In Magick, "text" and "string" are interchangeable. "Text" usually indicates that the text editor window is involved, or a long template is used. "String" is a more general term for a string of characters: letters, numbers and symbols. Generally we try to use "text" because it's a less confusing term. However in some places, for example for sockets, "string" is used.
